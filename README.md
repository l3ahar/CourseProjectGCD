Coursera-Getting and cleaning data-Project

The process that I went through to do the project was the same as stated in the problem statement. 

After extracting data I started from step 1 to concatenate test and train data.  
In the second step I made the data a bit tidy by choosing only some of the columns.
And in the 4th and 5th steps I changed labels for activities to human readable names and manipulated column names so they would be more human readable.  
At last I made a tidy data set and reshaped it as a wide tidy data.   

In the codebook I described the variables, data and transformations I performed to clean up the data.
